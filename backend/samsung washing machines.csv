Additionally, Samsung's front-load washer design, while popular, requires more maintenance to prevent mold and mildew growth. If cutting-edge technology, reliability, and a long lifespan are your priorities, Samsung is a great choice.

With a washing capacity of 22 kg, you can easily tackle bulky items like duvets, blankets, or heavy coats all in one go. However, keep in mind that the drying capacity is usually about half of that—around 11 kg—which is a common feature of combo units due to space and heat limitations. This generous capacity can really streamline laundry days, cutting down on the number of cycles you need, which is a real lifesaver for households that do a lot of washing.</p>\n<p data-start=""1351"" data-end=""2058"">That said, the size and weight of this model make it better suited for homes with dedicated laundry spaces rather than compact apartments. There’s a bit of a trade-off when it comes to capacity: while you can wash a full load, drying it all at once might mean you have to split larger washes into two cycles, which can add some extra time to your laundry routine. Compared to traditional washer and dryer sets, this combo design keeps everything in one spot, saving you floor space and eliminating the hassle of moving wet laundry between machines.</p>\n<p data-start=""1351"" data-end=""2058"">Plus, since it’s a front-loader, you can stack it with storage shelves or tuck it under counters, giving you more options for organising your laundry area. Just be sure to check the unit’s weight and dimensions before you buy, as a model designed for a spacious laundry room might not fit well in a smaller utility closet. While larger capacities can lead to longer cycle times, the convenience of washing and drying without having to manually transfer clothes is a significant perk for many users.</p>\n\n<h3 data-start=""2065"" data-end=""2110""> Smart &amp; AI-Driven Washing Features</h3>\n<p data-start=""2996"" data-end=""3843"">Samsung has packed the WD90F22BCSNQ with a bunch of smart technologies designed to make your laundry experience smoother and more efficient. One standout feature is the AI Wash Technology, which employs a series of sensors to assess the weight, soil level, and fabric type of your laundry. This means it can automatically tweak water levels, detergent amounts, and cycle times to give you a deeper clean while cutting down on wasted water and detergent—especially handy for those mixed loads that come with different levels of dirtiness.</p>\n<p data-start=""2996"" data-end=""3843"">When paired with Samsung’s EcoBubble™ technology, the detergent transforms into foam that seeps into fabrics quickly and effectively, even in cold water. This not only saves energy but also helps keep your clothes in great shape. Unlike traditional wash cycles that often need hot water to fully dissolve detergent, EcoBubble maintains its cleaning power while helping you save on utility bills.</p>\n<p data-start=""2996"" data-end=""3843"">The machine’s auto dispenser takes away the hassle of measuring out detergent and softener, automatically providing the right amounts for each load based on what it detects. This feature minimises the chances of using too much or too little detergent, prevents residue from building up on your clothes, and enhances fabric care. Plus, with smart connectivity through Wi-Fi and the SmartThings app, you can start, stop, or keep an eye on your laundry from anywhere. You’ll even get notifications when a cycle wraps up, making it easier to fit laundry into your busy life—especially after a long day at work or when you’re on the move. And with personalised cycle suggestions popping up on the 7” touchscreen interface, you can quickly find the best programs without having to scroll through endless menus or second-guess your settings.</p>\n\n<h3 data-start=""3850"" data-end=""3897""> Drying Capability &amp; Cycle Efficiency</h3>\n<p data-start=""4642"" data-end=""5322"">The drying function on the WD90F22BCSNQ cleverly uses a condenser or heat-based drying system right inside the same drum that does the washing. This design means you don’t need an external vent, which is a real plus for those living in apartments or tight utility closets where venting just isn’t an option. That said, combo dryers tend to be a bit slower and can use more energy compared to standalone dryers, especially when you're dealing with full loads.</p>\n<p data-start=""4642"" data-end=""5322"">This is because drying and moisture removal happen in the same space, and as you get closer to the maximum load, the drying performance can drop off. That’s why the drying capacity is about half of the washing capacity (around 11 kg)—trying to dry a full 22 kg wash in one go would be pretty inefficient and often not very effective. Even with these combo limitations, Samsung has added some handy dry programs like Hygiene Steam and Quick Wash &amp; Dry cycles for lighter loads or when you're in a hurry.</p>\n<p data-start=""4642"" data-end=""5322"">The steam features are great for reducing wrinkles and sanitising your clothes, which is especially helpful for items like bedding and towels. Plus, some users appreciate the auto-open door feature at the end of the drying cycle, which lets any leftover moisture escape and helps prevent that musty smell in your stored laundry. While the overall drying times might be longer than what you’d get with standalone units—or seem short compared to a fully vented dryer—many users find that the convenience of having a single machine makes it all worth it.</p>\n\n<h3 data-start=""5329"" data-end=""5366"">Build, Motor &amp; Performance</h3>\n<p data-start=""5949"" data-end=""6646"">Samsung has outfitted this model with a Direct Drive Digital Inverter Motor, which operates more quietly and reliably compared to the old-school belt-driven motors. This innovative technology cuts down on mechanical friction, boosting durability and possibly reducing the need for repairs. Samsung often backs these motors with impressive warranties—sometimes stretching up to 20 years—showing their confidence in the product's longevity. The diamond drum design features smoother contours, making it gentler on your clothes and helping to prevent snags and damage, especially for delicate fabrics like knits or synthetics.</p>\n<p data-start=""5949"" data-end=""6646"">The cycle intensity and spin speed are finely tuned to strike a balance between effective cleaning and fabric care. Higher spin speeds are great for wringing out more water from your clothes before they hit the dryer, which can help cut down drying times and enhance overall energy efficiency. Plus, the machine comes with specialised cycles like Hygiene Steam and Bubble Soak, which are perfect for tackling stubborn stains and allergens—especially useful for families with kids or anyone looking for a deep clean.</p>\n\n<h3 data-start=""6653"" data-end=""6698""> Energy, Water Use &amp; Sustainability</h3>\n<p data-start=""7296"" data-end=""7846"">Samsung washer-dryers, like the WD90F22BCSNQ, are crafted with a focus on energy and water efficiency. With features like EcoBubble™ and smart AI dosing, these machines help cut down on both water and electricity usage compared to older models or simpler combo units. Washing in cold water while still getting great cleaning results can really help reduce power consumption, especially when hot water isn’t necessary. Plus, the washer’s digital inverter motor plays a big role in saving energy by only using the power it needs and running more quietly.</p>\n<p data-start=""7296"" data-end=""7846"">That said, washer-dryer combos do tend to use more water during drying cycles than standalone dryers. This is because condenser drying relies on water to manage temperature and eliminate moisture through condensation. While this convenience is nice, it does mean that the total water used in a combined wash-and-dry cycle usually surpasses that of a washing machine on its own. This is something to keep in mind for those facing high utility bills or water supply issues; choosing the right cycle (like opting for shorter dry times for slightly damp items) can really help keep water usage in check.</p>\n\n<h3 data-start=""7853"" data-end=""7903""> User Experience &amp; Common Considerations</h3>\n<p data-start=""8435"" data-end=""9078"">Owners really love the convenience of being able to wash and dry their clothes all in one go—no need to transfer them between machines! The WD90F22BCSNQ stands out with its impressive capacity, which is a big plus for many users. However, some users do mention that combination units can be a bit slower than having separate machines, especially when it comes to drying cycles.</p>\n<p data-start=""8435"" data-end=""9078"">The temperature and moisture control might not be as efficient without a dedicated vent. There are mixed reviews about the long-term reliability of Samsung appliances, so it’s wise to check on service and maintenance options in your area before making a purchase. Keep in mind that wash-and-dry cycles can take several hours, so it’s a good idea to plan your laundry around your schedule to get the most out of this type of machine.</p>\n<p data-start=""8435"" data-end=""9078"">Check other Alternative Models, <a href=""https://housewifesparadise.com/product/samsung-front-load-washer-dryer-wd11dg5b15bbeu/"">Samsung Front Load Washer Dryer WD11DG5B15BBEU</a>, <a href=""https://housewifesparadise.com/product/samsung-front-load-washer-dryer-wd11db7b85gb/"">Samsung 11KG Front Load Washer Dryer WD11DB7B85GB</a></p>\n&nbsp;",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,239990,"Washing Machines > Samsung Washing Machines > Samsung Washer Dryers",,,"https://housewifesparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Samsung-22KG-Washer-Dryer-11KG-Dryer-Capacity-WD90F22BCSNQ.png, https://housewifesparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Samsung-22KG-Washer-Dryer-11KG-Dryer-Capacity-WD90F22BCSNQ-3.png, https://housewifesparadise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Samsung-22KG-Washer-Dryer-11KG-Dryer-Capacity-WD90F22BCSNQ-2.png",,,,,,,,,0,SAMSUNG,,,,,,,,
